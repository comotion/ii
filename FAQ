FAQ

Where is IRC command xy (ignore etc.)?
--------------------------------------
ii is for advanced users, please use standard tools like awk, sed and grep for
this. This can be done easily and will not bloat the code.

Where is a graphical interface? 
-------------------------------
Basically ii follows the UNIX philosophie so it is only file based. But it
should be easy to build different interface because they only have to handle
the FIFOs and output files. Feel free to implement or wait until we have done
this.

Which commands are supported?
 -----------------------------
j (join), t (topic), a (away), m (msg), n (nick), l (leave). The missing are
obsolete or can be easily used by typing the IRC commands itself (i.e. /WHO
instead of /who).
